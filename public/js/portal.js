/* Everything CrazyGames, kept in one file.

   The same build serves two places. On wallrush.online the game is its own
   page and nothing in here runs: `embedded` comes out false, the SDK is never
   fetched, and every function below returns immediately. Inside the portal the
   game sits in a frame on their page, and then the rules are theirs — our own
   banners must not appear, and the money comes from ads we ask them for.

   Two different questions, deliberately answered separately:

     embedded   — are we inside anybody's frame? Decides whether our banners
                  are allowed. Every portal forbids them, not only this one,
                  so the answer must not depend on recognising CrazyGames.
     inPortal() — is this really CrazyGames, with a working SDK? Decides
                  whether their calls do anything.

   Nothing here is allowed to throw. A portal is somebody else's page that can
   change without warning, and a game that dies because an ad call went
   missing is worse than a game with no ads. */
